// ### Glossary & concepts
//
// *Service* is a unit of an application with a unique name that other services
// use to refer to the functionality being called. Service instances are
// pods/VMs/containers that implement the service.
//
// *Service versions* - In a continuous deployment scenario, for a given service,
// there can be multiple sets of instances running potentially different
// variants of the application binary. These variants are not necessarily
// different API versions. They could be iterative changes to the same service,
// deployed in different environments (prod, staging, dev, etc.). Common
// scenarios where this occurs include A/B testing, canary rollouts, etc. The
// choice of a particular version can be decided based on various criterion
// (headers, url, etc.) and/or by weights assigned to each version.  Each
// service has a default version consisting of all its instances.
//
// *Source* - downstream client (browser or another service) calling the
// Envoy proxy/sidecar (typically to reach another service).
//
// *Host* - The remote upstream service to which the Envoy proxy/sidecar is
// talking to, on behalf of the source service. There can be one or more
// service versions for a given service (see the discussion on versions above).
// Envoy would choose the version based on various routing rules.
//
// *Access model* - Applications address only the destination service (Host)
// without knowledge of individual service versions. The actual choice of
// the version is determined by Envoy, enabling the application code to
// decouple itself from the evolution of dependent services.
//
//
//
// Route rule provides a custom routing policy based on the source and
// destination service versions and connection/request metadata.  The rule
// must provide a set of conditions for each protocol (TCP, UDP, HTTP) that
// the destination service exposes on its ports.
//
// The rule applies only to the ports on the destination service for which
// it provides protocol-specific match condition, e.g. if the rule does not
// specify TCP condition, the rule does not apply to TCP traffic towards
// the destination service.
//
// For example, the following rule routes all traffic by default to pods of
// reviews service with label "version: v1". In addition, HTTP requests
// containing for /api/v2/ url prefix will be sent to pods
// with label version: v2.
//
//     apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
//     kind: RouteRule
//     metadata:
//       name: my-rule
//     spec:
//       hosts:
//       - reviews
//       rules:
//       - http:
//         - match:
//           - uri:
//               prefix: "/api/v2"
//           route:
//           - destination:
//               name: reviews
//               labels:
//                 version: v2
//             weight: 100
//         - route:
//           - destination:
//               name: reviews
//               labels:
//                 version: v1
//             weight: 100
//
// Every service in the mesh can have utmost one route rule associated with
// the service name.  A single route rule can be used to describe traffic
// properties for multiple HTTP and TCP ports.
//
// Inheritance model: To allow multiple services to use a common set of
// settings (e.g., timeouts), route rules support inheritance. Route rules
// have a single inheritance model, with child rules overriding the default
// settings defined in the parent rule. The inheritance model based on the
// service's FQDN, with the catch all domain "*" at the root, followed by
// more specific sub domains such as *.com, and finally explicit service
// names such as example.com at the leaf of the inheritance tree.
//
// For example, in a system with services foo1.com, foo2.com, and bar.org,
//
//     hosts: * #applicable to foo1.com, foo2.com, and bar.org
//     |
//     |- hosts: *.com #applicable to foo1.com and foo2.com
//          |
//          |- hosts: foo1.com
//                    # inherits from * and *.com, and overrides settings
//
// _As described earlier, all rules derive from a single global wildcard
// rule._ For example, the following global base rule defines a universal
// timeout for HTTP requests.
//
//     apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
//     kind: RouteRule
//     metadata:
//       name: global-rule
//     spec:
//       hosts:
//       - * #no other hosts are allowed here.
//       rules:
//       - http:
//         - timeout: 1s
//           ...
//
// Domain suffix based rules can be defined to apply the same setting to a
// group of services under the suffix. For example, the following domain
// suffix based rule enables websocket support for all services in the
// "*.com" domain.
//
//     apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
//     kind: RouteRule
//     metadata:
//       name: com-rule
//     spec:
//       hosts:
//       - *.com
//       rules:
//       - http:
//         - websocketUpgrade: true
//           ...
//
// Service specific rules can be used to override global or sub domain
// properties. For example, the following rule for foo1.com overrides the
// global http request timeout of 1s (and uses a shorter 500ms timeout), in
// addition to defining URL rewrites.
//
//     apiVersion: config.istio.io/v1alpha2
//     kind: RouteRule
//     metadata:
//       name: foo1-rule

//           - uri:
//               prefix: /ratings
//           rewrite:
//             uri: /v1/bookRatings
//           timeout: 0.5s
//           ...
